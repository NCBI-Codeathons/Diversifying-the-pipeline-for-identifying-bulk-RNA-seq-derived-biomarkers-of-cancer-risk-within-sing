# Diversifying the pipeline for identifying bulk RNA-seq derived biomarkers of cancer within single cell populatins

Hackathon team: Sara Grimm, Jason Wang, Miko Liu, Matt Bernstein

## Background and Objective
Previous work by Matt Bernstein (and others) explored scRNA-seq data of 8 high-grade glioma tumor samples from "Single-cell transcriptome analysis of lineage diversity in high-grade glioma" by Yuan et al (PMID: 30041684). See https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/Identifying-bulk-RNA-seq-derived-biomarkers-of-cancer-risk-within-single-cell-populations for their results.  

Our primary objective is to extend their analysis by developing a method to stratify cells in a given scRNA-seq dataset according to malignancy status. For this stratification we rely primarily on a CNV (copy number variation) metric.  

We also hoped to (a) identify gene markers or gene sets correlated with malignancy status, and (b) associate specific cell types from clustered scRNA-seq data with malignancy status.  Unfortunately, despite several attempted methods, we were not successful in these endeavors.
